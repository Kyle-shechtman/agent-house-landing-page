          "An AI with access to your intelligence layer doesn't just process transactions. It understands why you make the decisions you make, what your customers truly value, and how to scale your unique approach. It can identify patterns you've missed, suggest strategies aligned with your growth plan, and operate with the wisdom of your best employees.",
